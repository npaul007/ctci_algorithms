Given an array with an array of integers and target integers.
Example:
num = [2, 7, 11, 15, 3, 5, 7, 5, 8]
target = 10
The output could be:
- two integers which add up to a target value.
- an array with just two numbers.
- we do not care about the order of the numbers.
- Return all the pairs without duplicates.
Example output:
[[7,3], [5,5], [2,8]]
You can write the algorithm in any programming language.
